# Discord-AutoMod
This is a discord bot designed to do some moderation tasks.  
This bot is written in [Python](https://www.python.org) and uses [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) ([on Github](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)).

## Stopped development

Recently, the developer of discord.py announced, that he ends development on his library. [For more info visit his repository.](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) Because I don't feel up to add slash commands myself or to implement the new discord-api myself, I'll end development on this bot as well. However, you can still use it until using slash commands is the only way to go. Of course you can make a fork to work on it too. Please note, that I won't go on updating the configuration guide you can find below too.
